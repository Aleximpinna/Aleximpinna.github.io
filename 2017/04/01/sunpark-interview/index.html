<p><strong>Hello Sun Park ! First, can you introduce yourself ?</strong><br>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/sunpark_tc" target="_blank" rel="external">Sun Park</a>, I make games at independent studio <a href="http://www.turtle-cream.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Turtle Cream</a>. Our studio based in Seoul, South Korea. I have found our studio in 2009 as a student dev team at first, and from 2011 we changed ourselves as a professional game dev studio.</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrU-3s5rmAU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><strong>With Turtle Cream, you’ve released two games for now : <em>Sugar Cube : Bittersweet Factory</em> and <em>6180 the moon</em>.<br>Did you work on these games alone ?</strong><br><em>Sugar Cube: BF</em> has been made by 3 developers. And when we made <em>6180 the moon</em>, we were 2 men dev team. We’re also 2 men dev duo now. I do game design and art, and my partner is a programmer. </p>
<p><strong>Is it you too who did the beautiful music of <em>6180 the moon</em> ?</strong><br>My wife is a music composer. She directed all music and made all music with her partner. She also made all music for <em>Sugar Cube</em> before.</p>
<p><strong>6180 is more poetical than political, however you said on your Twitter about <em>6180 the moon</em> : « Actually we haven’t released our game in KR [Korea] cuz we don’t agree with country’s game policies. ».<br>Can you tell me more about this policies ?</strong></p>
<p>In South Korea, regardless commercial, freeware, and even a homework project, all video games should pass government’s game rating system to publish on the internet. And the rating fee is more than 100 USD at least. Several years ago the government changed this policy so now mobile games don’t have to pass rating system, mobile platform holder should do their own rating system instead but essentially there is no change.<br>For example you’re student, and you made a tiny PC game as a practice. If you want to share your works via internet, you should pass government’s game rating system because uploading a game without rating is illegal. We don’t agree with this policy so we have quit to make Korean version to publish our game in Korea.</p>
<p><strong>South Korea is often see as one of the best country for professional players, so it’s easy to think that South Korea will be a paradise for game developers but it seems that it is quiet hard for indie games developers in South Korea. Why ?</strong><br>I have no idea how different is our situation with other countries. I think Korean gamers are really sensitive about trend. Normally only specific genres are popular in here so the industry is lack of diversity of genres. So surviving as an indie developer is very hard.<br>I’ve got shocked when I heard that some french indies can live with government’s support for citizens.<br>In my case I used to teach students from time to time, and I do several workshops to make money. I think this is actually same with other indies in outside of Korea. Living only with game sales is hard.</p>

<p><strong>You co-organize <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seoulindies/" target="_blank" rel="external">Seoul Indies</a> and <a href="https://www.outofindex.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Out of Index</a>.<br>Did you see any change in these two organizations during the years about the game developers ? Do Koreans want more indie games ? Is there more indie developers ?</strong><br>The reasons why we organize <strong>OOI</strong> and <strong>Seoul Indies</strong> are different. <strong>Seoul Indies</strong> is for gathering indie devs each other to share their experience and feedbacks. And the case of <strong>OOI</strong>, we willing to encourage Korean devs to make more experiment, instead of making just popular game genre. The number of indie devs are keep growing, and people are starting to interested in indie games. I’m not sure whether this situation will be better or not. But at least the community of indie devs is keep growing.</p>
<p><strong>What is the craziest game coming out from Out of Index ?</strong><br>All games are freaking awesome! It’s really hard to select only one game. My personal favorite are <em><a href="https://www.outofindex.org/2014expand" target="_blank" rel="external">Expand</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.outofindex.org/2015cerulean" target="_blank" rel="external">Cerulean Moon</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.outofindex.org/2016-controlmyself" target="_blank" rel="external">Control Myself</a></em> for each year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you work on a project right now ? If yes, can you telle me more ?</strong><br>Recently my partner got a day job. So from this year I’m trying to make my personal project. And I started monthly game dev project called <strong><a href="https://project99.itch.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Project.99</a></strong> with my friends to make experimental games in every month.<br>Our team Turtle Cream is also thinking about new game so stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your answers, now some fun questions !</strong><br><strong>What is the best game you recently played ?</strong><br>Actually I don’t play game much. Recently <em><a href="https://managore.itch.io/walkie-talkie" target="_blank" rel="external">Walkie Talkie</a></em> was really inspiring.<br>Also <a href="https://thumpergame.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Thumper</em></a> was really cool. I always interested in making a great music game as a music game lover. Oh I forgot to mention Overwatch! The only FPS game I play. :D</p>

<p><strong>What is the best game you ever played ?</strong><br>I always love brand new, unseen game mechanics, one of my best is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVVW41iAu5A" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Katamari Damacy</em></a>. I love its mechanic, graphic style, and music. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>Are you more PC or console ?</strong><br>PC.<br>Unfortunately I don’t have a console. I have a Xbox One devkit which could run as a retail machine though, I don’t have a TV either so playing console games is a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any recommendations ? (Book, Twitter account, movie…)</strong><br>I’m a big fan of Michel Gondry.<br>All films and music videos he made are full of inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>What other Korean game developer do you like/you want to mention ?</strong><br><a href="https://twitter.com/IndieSomi" target="_blank" rel="external">SOMI</a> is making great narrative games.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/fleepunk" target="_blank" rel="external">Jay Jeon</a> is making a adorable action game called <em><a href="http://www.gassymob.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Gassymob</a></em>.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/SingleCoreGames" target="_blank" rel="external">Jaewon Yoo</a> is making a great action shooter <em><a href="https://listege.itch.io/to-the-hell" target="_blank" rel="external">To The Hell</a></em>.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/gon08" target="_blank" rel="external">Gon Lee</a> is making game with old school LCD game style.<br>And lastly <a href="https://twitter.com/HandMadeGame" target="_blank" rel="external">Jake Jongwha Kim</a> is making VR Jenga game called <em><a href="https://www.handmadegame.net/cranga" target="_blank" rel="external">CRANGA!</a></em>(actually I made this title for him)</p>
<p><strong>What is your final word ?</strong><br>Thanks for your interest. Hope you see a beautiful moon tonight. Good night!</p>
<p><strong>In bonus, listen to the soundtrack of <em>6180 the moon</em> !</strong></p>
